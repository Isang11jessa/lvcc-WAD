                 Boracay’s White Beach Drops in World’s Top Beaches Ranking
        </div>
        
        <div class="box"><br>
            <p>Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:03 AM March 08, 2017</p>

ILOILO CITY—Amid increasing tourist arrivals, Boracay Island’s famous White Beach landed 24th among the top 25 beaches in the 2017 Travelers’ Choice Awards of popular travel site TripAdvisor.
The ranking was down from last year’s 12th place and 2015’s 7th place in the world category. In the Asian category, White Beach slid to second after leading the list since 2011.
White Beach, a 4-kilometer stretch of beach known for its powdery white sand and clear waters, is Boracay’s main attraction where the island’s hotels, restaurants and entertainment activities are concentrated.</div></p>

        <div class="box1"><br>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p>The ranking is based on reviews of travelers posted on the travel site. TripAdvisor claims to hold “435 million reviews and opinions covering 6.8 million accommodations, restaurants and attractions.”
Many of the recent reviews and comments in TripAdvisor praised White Beach and Boracay Island.
“This place is amazing. Lots of options to eat and drink. Tons of restaurants. Great sunset view. Sand is pure white and fine,” according to a post by Kris E from Toronto in Canada.
But Kris also commented on the algae growth in the water.
“The only issue is the water is green in the shallow part. Not sure if it is all year long or just in February but it looks horrible. I did not go in the water because of it,” Kris said.
TripAdvisor member Copacabana64 described White Beach as “one of the best beaches in the world.”
But some pointed out that the island has become overcrowded.
Tourist arrivals on the 1,032-hectare island reached 1,725,483 in 2016, 11 percent higher than the 1,560,106 tourists recorded in 2015, according to government records.
The island has been plagued by perennial problems, including environmental concerns blamed largely on unhindered development activities and poor enforcement of laws and regulations.</p> </div>

            Security tightened on Boracay Island for Asean meet
        </div>

        <div class="box2"><br>
<p>Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:30 AM January 31, 2017</p>
<p>ILOILO CITY—Police are deploying hundreds of officers and men to the world-famous Boracay Island to secure delegates who would attend one of the key meetings being held in preparation for the holding of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in the country.
Boracay is the venue of the Senior Officials’ Meeting and 23rd Meeting of Asean Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights from Feb. 13 to 15.
The island in Aklan province, famous for its white sand beaches, will also host the Asean Ministerial Meeting Retreat from Feb. 19 to 21. </p></div>

         <div class="box1"><br>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>SPO1 Nida Gregas, public information officer of the Aklan provincial police office, said at least 2,800 police officers and men and some 200 volunteers would be tapped to secure the venue of the meetings and other facilities that would be used by Asean delegates.
The security teams would guard airports in the capital town of Kalibo and the village of Caticlan in Malay town, which has jurisdiction over Boracay.
Jetty ports, billeting areas and roads to be used by delegates would be secured, too, according to Gregas.
Army soldiers and members of the Coast Guard would be tapped for security also, she said.
Thousands of delegates from Asean’s 10 member-countries are expected to be in Boracay during the meetings.
Traffic would be rerouted in the 1,032-hectare resort island, Gregas said.
Boracay is increasingly becoming a favorite venue of international meetings because of its international popularity.
Other Asean meetings would be held in Iloilo City and Bacolod City in March.

        ‘Diwata’ warns of siltation in Palawan coastline

The country’s “eye in the sky” is warning of possible siltation in Palawan province, touted as the Philippine’s last ecological frontier, after capturing what appeared to be suspended sediments in two of its coastal areas.
The latest report by the PHL Microsat program showed that Diwata-1, the Philippine’s first microsatellite, was able to capture a series of images of Palawan through its space-borne multispectral imager (SMI) in December last year.
It noted that being a Unesco Biosphere Reserve and a protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992, “monitoring developments in Palawan has always been a priority.”

“By harnessing Diwata’s capability of capturing images in the visible and near-infrared regions, [its] SMI could provide remotely sensed information on some of the current environmental issues in Palawan,” it said.
In one of Diwata’s snapshots of the province, “turbid sediment plumes” along the coastal waters off Brooke’s Point and Sofronio Española towns were “noticeable.”
The increased concentration of suspended sediments may be due to natural or human-induced soil erosion, according to the report.
Siltation is an environmental problem often caused by soil erosion or sediment spill. Among the harmful impacts of siltation include alteration of coastlines and changes in fish migration patterns. It may also damage the aquatic ecosystem.
While the images were part of an ongoing study that highlighted the many uses of Diwata-1, information gathered from the photographs should spur investigation and further study, according to Carlos Primo David, executive director of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Research and Development (DOST-PCIEERD).
“More imaging will also be done,” David told the Inquirer on Monday.
The report noted that the watershed reserve in Palawan was vulnerable to soil erosion, especially when its forest cover had been reduced due to its topography—narrow mountain ranges, steep runoff slopes and meandering rivers.
It said the two towns have vast agricultural lands and agricultural activities, such as plowing and tilling methods, which could induce soil erosion.
The use of pesticides and fertilizers also aggravates the situation as these can be transported to the coasts through surface runoff, which can be detrimental to the marine ecosystem, according to the report.
“Moreover, it is interesting to further investigate whether the apparent siltation observed along the coast of Sofronio Española is indeed suspended sediments or just the shallower parts of the coast,” it said.
The report said Diwata-1, through its SMI, captured an image of a nickel mining site in the middle of a densely forested area in Sofronio Española. The snapshot showed that the mining site has “lower normalized difference vegetation index,” a measure for estimating vegetation health and density.
“Since river systems are agents of sediment transport toward the coastal areas, it is important to look into their tracks to monitor potential sources and points of contamination,” it said.
The PHL Microsat program is a collaboration between the DOST, University of the Philippines Diliman and Japan’s Hokkaido University. The program saw the launch of Diwata-1 in April last year, the first Filipino-built microsatellite. It aims to launch another satellite in the next two years.</p></div>

             Regions Briefs: BFAR Raises Red Tide Alert in Puerto Princesa
        </div>

        <div class="box4"><br>     
<p>Residents and visitors in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan province were advised against eating shellfish after the red tide alert was raised in the Puerto Princesa Bay. This brought to 12 the areas nationwide where harmful algal bloom was prevalent, according to the latest bulletin from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). BFAR said shellfish collected in these areas were found positive for paralytic shellfish poison beyond the regulatory limit. The agency said all kinds of shellfish and krill-like prawns (alamang) from an area under red tide alert should not be harvested, sold or eaten. However, fish, squid, shrimps and crabs are safe for human consumption provided these are fresh and washed thoroughly, and internal organs are removed before cooking. The problem results from the excessive blooming of harmful algae that produce toxins that are harmful to people and other marine animals, the BFAR said. Also on red tide alert are eight areas between the islands of Samar and Leyte, including coastal waters of Biliran province; Leyte province including Carigara Bay; Matarinao Bay in Eastern Samar; Maqueda, Villareal, Cambatutay and Irong-Irong Bays and Daram Island in Western Samar; Gigantes Islands in Carles, Iloilo; Dauis and Tagbilaran City in Bohol; and Balite Bay in Davao Oriental. —RONNEL W.
